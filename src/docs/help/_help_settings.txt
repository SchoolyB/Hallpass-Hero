Runtime logging can help you keep track of what is happening in the background of Hallpass Hero, as well as help you troubleshoot any issues you may encounter. However, runtime logging can also take up a lot of space on your hard drive, so it is recommended to only enable runtime logging when you are actively troubleshooting an issue.

Skipping the bulk data loader confirmation can save you time and effort when you are loading a large amount of data into Hallpass Hero. If enabled you will not need to confirm all the entered information of each student after its entered while using the bulk data loader. If disabled you will need to confirm all the entered information of each student every single time. This can be very time consuming if you are loading a large amount of data. If you are confident in the accuracy of the data you are entering it is recommended to enable this setting.
